# Contributing

Welcome. This is an open repository. You don't need to know Montelibero to contribute — bring a good idea and follow the process.

---

## Quick start

| You want to... | Do this |
|----------------|---------|
| Propose a new protocol or standard | [Open a RFC proposal issue](../../issues/new?template=rfc-proposal.yml) |
| Fix a typo or small clarification | Open a PR directly |
| Discuss an existing RFC | Comment on its open PR |
| Propose a major change to an Active RFC | Open a new RFC that supersedes it |

---

## RFC process in short

1. Open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new?template=rfc-proposal.yml) with label `rfc-proposal`
2. A [SlopTask](https://slop.mtlprog.xyz) ticket is created and assigned
3. Open a PR with `rfc/XXXX-name.md`, Status: `Draft`
4. Discuss in PR comments, iterate
5. When ready: change status to `Review`, wait 3 days
6. No blocking objections → merged → `Active` or `Final`

Full details in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Style guide

- Language: **English** — file names, frontmatter, document body, PR titles, issue titles
- File names: `kebab-case`, ASCII only
- People: GitHub `@handle`; Stellar addresses for on-chain references
- Keep it short. Say what the thing is and why it matters. Skip the preamble.
